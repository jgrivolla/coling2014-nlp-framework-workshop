Submissions must describe original and unpublished work.
The following two types of submissions will be accepted:

- *Long papers* (maximum 8 content pages + 2 extra pages for references): Long papers should report on substantial research including new approaches, resources and/or techniques.
- *Short papers* (maximum 5 content pages + 2 extra pages for references): Short papers should report on small focused contributions, ongoing research, negative results and/or philosophical discussion.

Papers will be presented orally or as posters â€“ the decision on presentation format will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.

Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no information that could identify the authors should be included in the papers; for example, self-reference should be avoided.

Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, thoroughness, significance, contributions to research resources, and replicability. All submissions must be in PDF format and must follow the COLING 2014 formatting requirements. See other COLING 2014 style files.

At least one of the authors must register for the workshop to ensure the inclusion of the paper in the proceedings. It is also expected that at least one author for each accepted submission personally attends and presents the work at the workshop.

Submissions for the workshop are open. They are being handled entirely online, hosted by the [START conference manager](https://www.softconf.com/coling2014/WS-11/). To submit works, please [click here](https://www.softconf.com/coling2014/WS-11/). Once linked, you will use your START account and password or create them, which will allow you to return to your submission at a later time for updates, withdrawals, and completion, up to the May 2 deadline.
