Helix Conference Centre at Dublin City University (DCU)  
August 23rd 2014

Description
-----------

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of the
requirements for an envisaged open “global laboratory” for HLT research and
development and establish the basis of a community effort to develop and support
it. To this end, the workshop will include both presentations addressing the
issues and challenges of developing, deploying, and using the global laboratory
for distributed and collaborative efforts and discussion that will identify next
steps for moving forward, fostering community-wide awareness, and establishing
and encouraging communication among the various players.

It aims at bringing together members of the NLP community, specifically users,
developers or providers of components and tools for these frameworks, in order to
explore and discuss the opportunities and challenges in using such platforms for
modern, well-engineered NLP applications.
